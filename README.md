# qsign
 QSign is my graduation project that tackles the issue of signature forgery in online learning environments. I developed a digital signature website utilizing ECDSA-based signatures wrapped in QR codes for enhanced security. This innovation allows users to verify signatures via QR scan or document upload, ensuring authenticity and expediting approvals, even when lecturers are off-campus. By addressing these challenges, the project aims to streamline the document signing process in remote academic settings.<br>
